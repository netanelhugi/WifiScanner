This is our github repository for course tasks.<br />
The repository contains our java project,input&output files, javaDoc and other assignments docs.<br />

**How to run?**<br />
First we use the csv files from the app "wiggle-wifi". all the files from app we put into one folder("c:/wifiScanner"). <br />
after that we call to the funcion "fileReader"(from "wifiScanner" class, mainPackage), the function merge all the files into one file according to the format you requested in the assignment. <br />
On this file that we create, you can use the filters(from filters package) and filter the csv file by time, loction, date and user name.<br />
The filters send the data to new csv&kml files. <br />
in the Kml file We show the wifi points loctions(we used algorithm1 from assignment2 to calculate the weighted position of every mac address).<br />

All files exported from the program you can find in project's workspace.
